## Goals
* Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News
* Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

## SCRAPE TITLES AND PREVIEW TEXT FROM MARS NEWS

* Automated browsing (with Splinter) was used to visit the Mars news site, and the HTML code was extracted (with Beautiful Soup).
* The titles and preview text of the news articles were scraped and extracted.
* The scraped information was stored in the specified Python data structureâ€”specifically, a list of dictionaries.

## SCRAPE AND ANALYZE THE MARTIAN WEATHER DATA
The HTML table was extracted into a Pandas DataFrame and Splinter and Beautiful Soup were used to scrape the data. The data was analyzed to answer the following questions:

  * How many months exist on Mars?

  * How many Martian days' worth of data is in the dataset?
